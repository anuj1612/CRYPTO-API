# CRYPTO-API
It was a self-improvement project to understand how API works. I wrote a python program integrating a free crypto api that could fetch data of certain crypto currencies (eg. price, liquidity, market cap) related to blue-chip and stable stocks. The code fetches the data at a fix time of 4AM of the specified date and is then put in an excel.
